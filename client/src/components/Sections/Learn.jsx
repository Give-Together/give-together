                      By activating your DAI on Give Together your interest will
                      be transferred to the Give Together Smart Contract at
                      0x123. This contract determines a new charity to give to
                      each week and at the end of the week we will activate the
                      donate function to send the money to the chosen charity.

                      Each week a new charity is chosen to receive the interest
                      from the donors on Give Together. The donation will go
                      directly to the charities ETH accounts. A full list of the
                      charities supported can be found{" "}
